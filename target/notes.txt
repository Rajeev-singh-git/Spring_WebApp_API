Step 2

ComponentScan defines where it should look for component
 Service class is outside com.in28minutes.springboot package so it 
 won't be scanned automatically. So we need to add ComponentScan
 annotation telling  SpringBoot where to look for component.
 It is inside sub-package of ("com.in28minutes") so we added that.
 
 @SpringBootApplication adds @ComponentScan by default to current 
 package which in our case is (com.in28minutes.springboot;)
 



Step 4

Spring Boot manages version for all it's dependencies automatically.
If we upgrade spring boot version, it will automatically upgrade
version of all it's  dependencies.
We can see details in "Spring Boot Starter Parent"
We can also, override dependency version in POM.XML properties. 
In our code we have overridden java version to 13.
